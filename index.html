            <h2>Hi, I'm Colin...</h2>
            <p>...and I do cool shit sometimes - like coding this entire website from scratch.</p>

    <p>I just finished writing a golf simulator entirely in client-side JavaScript. The game is still very basic, but I'm proud of what I made.<br>
        The idea was to build off of what I learned in the <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">course</a> I took, and to take what I know and implement it into a project that I like.</p>
            <p>You can play the game <a href="https://cklgaming.github.io/lawnChairSimulator">here</a>.</p><br>
    <p>Right now, I'm working on a new e-commerce brand, The 19th Hole. It's still in development, but when it launches, you can find that <a href="https://19thholegolf.us">here</a>.</p><br>

    <p>Everything else is a little slow right now, mostly because I'm getting ready for college again, and coaching football in the fall (also i kinda forgot i made this...but we won't talk about that). Updates will still come, but less frequently.<br>
                I'm also trying to figure out what I should write about next, since it's been a while.</p><br>
    <p>This page is still a work in progress, so check back later for updates.</p>
