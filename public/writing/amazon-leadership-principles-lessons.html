        <h1>Lessons I Learned from Amazon’s 16 Leadership Principles and How I’m Working to Create My Own</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>A few months ago, I came across a podcast called “Founders” by David Senra. In his podcast, David reads books detailing the lives and the work of some of the greatest entrepreneurs ever, and takes away lessons and ideas for his listeners to use in his work. The specific episode that I had found was titled “Working with Jeff Bezos”. I was intrigued, because Jeff Bezos is, arguably, the most successful entrepreneur from the last 30 years. The specific book David was reading was called “Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon”. After listening to the episode, I knew I had to buy the book and read it for myself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Two months later, I had finally gotten the book. Now, waiting two months to read one book may not seem like that big of a deal, but this book was at the top of my reading list from the time I finished that episode until I finally cracked it open one December morning. I’m not much of a reading guy, and I have quite a lot going on in my life, so I’ve only made it through the first chapter in the two and a half months that I’ve had this book, but I didn’t even need to make it through the first chapter to find the part of the book that changed my entire way of thinking and my entire approach to creating projects and building a business: the Amazon Leadership Principles.</p>
        <br>
        <p>These principles have consumed my thinking ever since I came across them, so much so that I have an entire page in my Notion dedicated to the Principles, and I go through them frequently in order to refresh my own way of thinking, and in order to figure out how to create my own list, specific to my ideas and values. Many people are familiar with the idea of “Core Values”, which are probably posted on the wall somewhere in your office, or on some website somewhere. However, I don’t think many understand exactly how formative this set of Principles can be, and has been for me.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The book, having been released in 2021, is already a bit dated, as Amazon has already added two more Principles to their list, making 16 in total, though the book only has 14. For the sake of brevity, I’ll pick my favorite 5, and give you a lesson I learned with each.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>1. Customer Obsession</h2>
        <p><i>“Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Jeff’s obsession with customers is one of the core ideas outlined in this book. He wasn’t just the big boss, who told everyone what to do and how to do it; he actually did it with them on a day-to-day basis. The book tells us that Jeff proofread every customer service email, not allowing it to be sent until it was perfect, posted job descriptions, packed shipments, and much more. He was directly involved in almost every part of the business, “apart from writing the all-important software.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>This obsession over customers is something that should be present in every business. No business can make profits without customers, and profits rise the more customers you retain and satisfy. Even in interactions with people on a day-to-day basis, an obsession over “customers” should take first priority over everything, helping you gain more connections and even formulate friendships.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>2. Ownership</h2>
        <p><i>“Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. they never say “That’s not my job.”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>This one in particular is huge. How often do we see somebody at a fast food restaurant or a supermarket aisle say “That’s not my job” or “I don’t do that”? I know because I’ve been guilty of this myself, at past jobs. Many are there just to show up, collect their paycheck, and go home. They don’t care about your experience or representing the company they work for, they just want to go home.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Amazon found a unique way to combat this. Their compensation structure gives employees in a leadership position equity in the company, in hopes this will incentivize them further to promote long-term gains over short-term benefits.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Extreme ownership is a great idea that I learned about a while back, which applies to this Principle. Having first come to light from the Navy SEALS, it encourages members of a team to be willing to take responsibility for the failures of the team, regardless of if they were directly responsible. All teams, business, sports, or otherwise, should take note of this idea and do their best to apply it as often as possible, as it forces every member to step up and do their part and more in order to ensure the team’s success.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Learn and Be Curious</h2>
        <p><i>“Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>This one is more of a personal favorite than one I learned from. Another line from the Principle “Invent and Simplify” says “[Leaders] … look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” I think that line would almost go better with this principle, because I think it’s always a mark of a good leader that they continue to learn new things and try to improve themselves and find new skills.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I’m constantly looking for new ideas and frameworks to help me in my thinking or in my work, no matter where they come from. I’ve found that the best way to do things is to continuously take information from a variety of different sources, and then put it all together and simplify the topic.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>4. Insist on the Highest Standards</h2>
        <p><i>“Leaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>That’s quite the language, right? “Relentlessly high standards”, “unreasonably high”, “continuously raising the bar”. Those few sentences make you understand how Amazon has been able to have sustained success for so long, and why they seem primed to stay at the top for many more years.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now, every company wants to do their best, all the time. But Amazon wants their employees to take it to the next level. And I think every company or team worth their value should do the same.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>5. Bias for Action</h2>
        <p><i>“Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Another personal favorite. Bias for action is the most valuable trait an entrepreneur can have, and the same for any exec or employee. Speed does matter, and the faster you make decisions, the more you will gain on your competitors.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Another one of my favorite frameworks is the 80/20 rule. The rule says that 80% of the results come from 20% of the inputs, and that before you do anything – learning something, making a decision, etc. – you should identify that 20% that will lead to 80% of the results, and prioritize that. This is another framework that I use frequently, and I’ve been able to tie it into this Principle as well.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>These are just my top 5 favorite Principles. There are 11 more, and all of them are very powerful, getting the point across quickly and effectively. Amazon uses these in everything they do day-to-day, and they are instilled into the mind of every employee. Every performance evaluation, hire, and promotion are based almost solely on these Principles as well.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On my Notion page where I have these Principles all listed, I have a line above the first Principle. It reads “Change and adapt these to fit your own needs and purpose. No one set of principles will fit every person or every business. These should not serve as your own set of principles or values, but rather inspiration to create your own.” I’ve been thinking over the past few weeks, evaluating each of these Principles and their role in my life. Some of these can be made more succinct and merged, making a shorter and even better list of principles in order to make them more effective.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Over the next few weeks, months, and even years, I’m going to continue to refine and revise this list. I think having a list of set principles to be able to live by and refer to throughout your life is a great thing to have, and, if done correctly, can lead to quicker decision-making and a better thought process. This won’t be a fast process, but it will be worth it.</p>
