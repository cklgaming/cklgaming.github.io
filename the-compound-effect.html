        <h1>The Compound Effect: My Notes</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>One quote that has stuck with me for a long time is one typically used on X by Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom), is this: “Anything above zero compounds”. Now, I’m not giving him all the credit for the idea, but simply saying that the way he explained it resonated with me (and his posts never fail to inspire me). But the point is, it’s a simple and easy way to remember that even if you don’t have the most optimal conditions, even if you do anything towards a goal each day, you will make progress. This is an idea I’ve essentially based my life on over the last year, making sure that even if I’m not feeling well or have a lot going on, that I’m at least doing something.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But Darren Hardy takes this approach one step further. He not only simplifies it even more by giving us the motto “No Zero Days”, but he also goes much deeper into how to go about this and how you can change your life for the better with just a few minor fixes. Here, I’ll go through my takeaways from this book, and how I’m going about implementing these into my own life.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>1. You Need to Be Self-Aware</h2>
        <p>I put this first because this is the underlying, yet unspoken theme of the entire book. Nothing else on this list can be done if you aren’t able to be self-aware about your own shortcomings in life. It’s a tough task, because most people would much rather just knowingly look over bad habits or excuses they make that they believe are important to their life or their personality. And that’s perfectly fine. But reading this book (and following these steps) requires change. And that’s going to be uncomfortable for everyone, whether you like it or not.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>2. One Degree Changes Can Have Massive Results</h2>
        <p>An example Darren uses in the middle of the book: if you were to start at LAX, and fly to New York City, but the plane’s direction was altered by just one degree, you would end up 150 miles away, in either Delaware or Albany. That’s a huge change for just a one degree alteration at the start of the journey. And this is another big theme throughout the book: small steps will lead to big results. Darren suggests to sit down, find your bad habits, find your excuses, and cut them out of your life, even if it is just a little bit at a time. Then, he says, replace those with small steps, good habits, and continue these good habits every day. Because eventually, these good habits will start stacking up and they’ll make a huge change in your life vs. when you first started.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Another example Darren uses is asking if you’d rather be given a penny that magically compounded itself every day for 30 days, or be given $3,000,000. And by now, most people know this story. But if you don’t, it’s likely you chose the $3,000,000. However, once the 30 days are up, you’d be amazed to find out that you just passed on an extra $2,368,709.12! A penny compounded each day turns out to $5,368,709.12. And Darren uses this as a perfect metaphor for our habits and how they compound regularly for us. Now, human habits take a lot more time to compound 500,000,000x, so don’t go looking for 30-day abs in hope that you’ll look like 5 million bucks by the end of the month. Instead, invest in yourself and your own habits, those are the ones that will compound.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Start TODAY</h2>
        <p>This quote wasn’t from Darren, but I heard it recently and it fit well with this topic: “Tomorrow is where dreams go to die.” Now, that isn’t to say that you’re going to immediately fail tomorrow no matter what you’re doing, or that you’ll realize that you won’t achieve any of your goals. It’s telling you not to put anything off until “tomorrow”, because then, that thing might never get done. And this doesn’t just mean the next day, specifically. This goes for all those people who say “I’ll start next week”, or “That’s a great New Year’s goal”. Then, next week comes around and they say, “Ah, I’ll do it next week”, and so on, and that “next week” never comes. And New Year’s comes and goes and either they forgot about it or decided it wasn’t worth their time. Start now, because not only will you get the benefit of a few extra days of compounding, but you’ll also actually do the thing.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>4. People Matter</h2>
        <p>“Well obviously people matter, what’s the big deal with this one?” No, the people you spend your time with matter. This includes your drinking buddies, book club friends, the one woman you always yell at when you pick up your kids from school, everyone. Because everyone you encounter has an effect on you as a person, beyond just taking your time. And the five people you spend the most time around have even more of an effect. A study once told us that we are the average of the five people we spend the most time around. Actually, that’s not true. In another great X thread, Sahil says “behavior converges to the lowest common denominator”, meaning, if someone around you is lower than you on a behavioral level, you might be pulled down to their level. If you want to really excel in life, make a habit of getting around people higher than you, that you might be pulled up to them, and grow yourself in the process.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Darren encourages his readers to be ruthless with their top five friends, because without understanding who you spend the most time around and how they impact your life, and without optimizing your friend group to have the best possible returns on your life, you’ll be stuck in the same spot, unable to grow yourself.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>5. Do Extra</h2>
        <p>Another great example from this book. Darren tells us that a young Arnold Schwarzenegger would get to the end of his last set, then “cheat” out a couple more reps, just in order to do extra. And by doing that little bit extra, his results were that much better.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Think about it like compound interest. If you put $1,000 in a savings account with a 5% yield, and then left it alone for 20 years, not adding any more to it, you’d come away with $2,653.30, if compounded annually. Now, if you added just $100 more to that initial amount, for an initial principal of $1,100, you’d come away with more than $250 extra. The value of doing just a little bit extra goes a long way.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But this doesn’t stop at fitness or money, either. Darren tells us that he’s done the same thing in his marriage, every day writing down a few things his wife does that he’s thankful for. And then on Thanksgiving, he gives her the journal for the entire year, with all of the days of thankfulness inside. He says just that little bit of extra effort paid off big dividends. This strategy can do big things in any aspect of your life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“The Compound Effect” was, to date, one of the most influential books I’ve read in my life. After not having read regularly for years, when I was given this book, I sat down every night and read as much as I could before falling asleep. It got to the point where I couldn’t wait to get to crack open the book again to learn more and see how I could implement this in my own life. I hope you take as much from this as I did, and are able to use it to make big changes in your own life in the future.</p>
