        <h1>How I Use ChatGPT, and What I'm Using it For Today</h1>
        <hr>

        <sub>Note: Unfortunately, as I was in the middle of writing this piece, I found out that OpenAI released their own guidelines to using ChatGPT. Hopefully, you’ll still find this useful, as I’m just a normal person talking to you, instead of a developer telling you how to use their own product.</sub>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a sweeping phenomenon that has largely mystified the human race since the public release of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) on November 30, 2022. Since the day of its release, everybody and their mother have taken to X (formerly Twitter) to give their thoughts and tell you exactly how to “get ahead of everyone else” by showing you how to use the chatbot. And now, over a year later, I think it’s my turn to join in and show you exactly how I use ChatGPT and what results I get from it. I’ll also show the project I’m working on exclusively using ChatGPT and what my goal is by doing it this way.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>How I Use ChatGPT (GPT-3.5)</h2>
        <p>The first thing you have to understand is that I’m a broke college kid, and can’t afford to pay for ChatGPT Plus so I can use the new version of the bot (GPT-4). Trust me, I’d love to be able to use it, and it would be so much more helpful, but I can’t spend $20/month on that.</p>
        <br>
        <p>That aside, I’ll break down my tips into a few subheadings in order to make it easy for those of you who just want to skim this page and read the big text without taking the five extra minutes to read what’s under it. (That’s okay, I won’t judge, I totally didn’t spend two hours putting this all together for you…)</p>
        <br>
        <h2>1. Understand Who You’re Talking To</h2>
        <p>The first thing that I feel many people don’t understand is that they’re talking to a computer. This isn’t just some customer service rep from the Philippines who spends all day just answering your dumb questions or acting as your therapist. You’re talking to a computer which has been programmed to answer your questions or prompts in a certain way. This seems cool and all, but you have to remember one thing when crafting your prompts: Computers only do what you tell them to, there is no implying or understanding with a computer. You have to be very specific with your prompts, or there is a possibility that you will get an incorrect answer or an answer that was not what you were looking for.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>2. Give the Bot a Personality</h2>
        <p>This one seems weird, given that I just explained how this is a computer and you have to be very specific with what you want it to do. However, I’ve found I get better results when I do this. If you’re asking the bot one, simple question, this isn’t needed. However, if you have a series of questions or a prompt that might require a longer answer, I would suggest you use this in order to receive a better answer.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At the start of the prompt, give the bot whatever personality you would like it to take. For example (take notes, fellow college students), if you need it to give ideas for an essay, you might say something like the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“You are a creative writing professor at a renowned university…”</li>
            <li>“You are a bestselling fiction author with multiple successful book series…”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Or if you want help with a design idea:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“You are an experienced freelance designer who I’ve commissioned to help with a project…”</li>
            <li>“You are an employee at a graphic design firm that I’ve hired to help me with ideas for a brand design…”</li>
        <ul>
        <p>You get the point. Although GPT-3.5 doesn’t work with images, it can give you text representations or breakdowns or designs. But this doesn’t have to be restricted to creative projects. This technique can be used for any kind of prompt where a certain personality would help give a better answer.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Be Unnecessarily Specific With Your Prompts</h2>
        <p>Earlier on, I mentioned “crafting” your prompt. And that’s the kind of mentality you want to take when giving input to an AI model. As I’ve discussed, computers only understand what you tell it. It’s unable to understand the kind of conversation we would typically have with another human, when we imply things or use expressions to mean different things than the actual definition of the words we use. Words mean things, even more so when giving input to an artificial intelligence models.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When giving a prompt to a chatbot, a general rule of thumb is to be “unnecessarily specific” with your prompts. To use the essay example again, instead of saying “write a three-page essay”, give a specific word count. Ask for a specific format, ask it to speak in a certain style and a certain tone. You can customize all of these to your liking in order to craft the perfect essay, rather than re-rolling responses until you find something you like. And, like I said earlier, this doesn’t stop at writing. If you’re asking for a crafted morning routine, give the time you wake up and the amount of time you’d like to spend getting ready in the morning, and ask for specific time spaces for each action. Specificity will allow you to receive much better answers than using basic language when prompting the bot. This all seems unnecessary when talking to another human, but that’s far from the case when using chatbots.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>4. Reiterate Information (Even If It Seems Overly Repetitive)</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, many AI models (especially GPT-3.5) have problems with context. It’s been well-documented that many models have a limited range of context, which makes it hard for them to answer questions with many parts. And this shows very often as well. Sometimes, without being able to reach certain context from earlier in the conversation, models will give an answer that seems silly based on the context (that it obviously missed).</p>
        <br>
        <p>I’ve found that, in order to ensure the best results possible, continuing to provide the bot with context and reiterating information has shown success, especially when working on long-term projects with the help of artificial intelligence. Continue to state the goal of your conversation or the steps which you want to take. Even asking it to continually provide you information which was discussed earlier is very helpful. This helps keep much of the information in context for the bot, which makes it easier to retain information and answer long-winded questions.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>5. Outlines Are Your Best Friend</h2>
        <p>This one is very self-explanatory. I’ve found that in my discussions with AI models, asking for detailed outlines of our conversation or a step-by-step process of the project I’m trying to complete is a big part of success. It helps keep information in bite-sized chunks, making it easier for the human to digest and quickly move on, while the bot can understand each step of the outline and expand on it when needed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For example, if you’re attempting to have the chatbot walk you through a project, I would suggest your first few prompts begin like this. First, you give the bot whatever personality you would like for it to take on, then, in the same prompt, explain what you want to gain from the conversation, and state the goal. Then, break it down into smaller goals, parts that you would like to happen as the project begins to take its shape. Lastly, ask the bot for any questions or clarifications needed, and request a detailed outline for the project at hand. This helps you understand exactly what you’ll be doing, and how well the model understood your prompts. Once you’re sure you’ll get the response you’re looking for, go knock out your objectives.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Artificial intelligence is taking a bigger spot in my life as I continue to use it day-to-day for different tasks, and I’m learning more about it and how to use different models all the time. My most recent project that I’m working on, with the help of ChatGPT, is a new productivity app and habit tracker. It should be ready in time for the New Year so you can start your year off well, keeping yourself accountable for your goals. I’ll be writing more about it in the future, and when it’s ready for release, I’ll have it displayed on this site for you all to see.</p>
