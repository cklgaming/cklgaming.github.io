        <h2>Project Roadmap</h2>
        <sub>Here's a list of all of the projects I've either started working on or want to in the future, along with a quick description of each.</sub>

            <dt>Personal Website - In progress</dt>
            <dd>I'm currently trying to learn to code, going from HTML to CSS and eventually JavaScript, as well as databases, frontend and backend frameworks. I figure coding my own personal website from scratch is a good way to get some tangible experience, aside from just doing one course after another.</dd>
            <br>

            <dt>E-commerce Brand - In progress</dt>
            <dd>Currently building a golf apparel brand, <a href="https://19thholegolf.us">The 19th Hole</a>, and I wrote about it <a href="">here</a>. It's still in progress, but I'll share updates when I can.</dd>
            <br>

            <dt>Football Digest Website - In progress</dt>
            <dd>Apparently I can never have "too much" on my plate. I'm planning on building a community for football coaches of all levels. I'm still planning out all the details, but you can find that <a href="https://footballdigest.co">here</a>.</dd>
