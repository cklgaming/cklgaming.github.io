            <dt>Personal Website - In progress</dt>
            <dd>I'm currently trying to learn to code, going from HTML to CSS and eventually JavaScript, as well as databases, frontend and backend frameworks. I figure coding my own personal website from scratch is a good way to get some tangible experience, aside from just doing one course after another.</dd>
