        <h1>PSA to Lions Fans: You Don't Need to Press the Red Button</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>When the Bears pulled out to an early 10-0 lead on Sunday, many Lions fans were thinking the same things my dad and I were telling each other: It's a repeat of three weeks ago, Aaron Glenn needs to be fired, etc. etc. But we all missed one thing: we were saying these things with 45 minutes of football still left to be played. In the second quarter, our mood swings continued, with the Lions taking the lead on a Goff-to-Reynolds TD pass with 26 seconds left. After John Cominsky's sack of Justin Fields to round out the first half, our spirits were high, thinking the Lions were going to avoid that repeat of the game at Ford Field.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But we had forgotten something again: There was still 30 minutes left of football to play, and the Lions have been notoriously bad coming out of halftime this season. After the first three-and-out of the day from Ben Johnson's offense after receiving the second half kickoff, Fields promptly led the Bears offense down the field, with the drive only ending in a Cairo Santos chip shot field goal because of a rush for no gain and two incompletions on the Detroit 7-yard line. Two more Lions punts later, Fields caught Aidan Hutchinson offsides on a fourth-and-thirteen from the Lions' 38, and threw a dot to DJ Moore to put Chicago up six. And after that? The ball just kept rolling for the Bears, and Detroit was stuck in neutral. A failed Graham Glasgow snap gave the Bears the ball with 29 yards to the end zone, and once again, Fields took advantage, extending the lead to twelve.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, not all hope was lost for the Lions, as they had been here before. Actually, just three weeks ago. But two failed 4th down conversions and one interception later, the Bears held on for the win this time, giving the Lions their second loss in three weeks.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">-- --</p>
        <p>This marks a stretch of five straight games where the Lions have been delivered a scare, four of which ended in one-score games, and one which ended in a fifteen-point loss. And complaints are all over the place. Fire Aaron Glenn, trade Jared Goff, this and that. But, just like Sunday afternoon, there are four things that many fans of the Honolulu Blue are missing...</p>
        <br>
        <h2>1. This is a young team.</h2>
        <p>This is a Detroit Lions team that is still just two years removed from a 3-13-1 season. Not that many of you need reminding, but some fans act like this is an established team which should be used to winning games. No, this is a team that finished one game over .500 for the first time in five years last season, and just the sixth time since 2000. This is a team whose longest-tenured player is Taylor Decker, a 30-year old left tackle who was here for all of the Patricia/Quinn days and is starting to get his first taste of winning. This is a team whose oldest player is 36-year old Jake McQuaide, who was signed to the practice squad just weeks ago when starter Scott Daly was injured. Second place? 31-year old backup QB Teddy Bridgewater. And fourth is Decker. This is a team missing their starting right guard, starting safety, starting cornerback, starting defensive tackle, and many rotational players who could be making an impact. This is not to mention that a former undrafted free-agent, Kayode Awosika, has started three games, and played in 11 of the 13 in total.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This team is young, and many of them just played in their first winning season last year, a season in which they went on an ten-game heater (going 8-2), after starting the season 1-6, and many had written them off. This team is not used to playing ahead, and having a target on their backs. This team is not used to being three games ahead on the rest of the division. This team is not used to being the favorite. Give them some time to acclimate.</p>
        <h2>2. This team has improved in one-score games.</h2>
        <p>Two years ago, the Lions were 2-6-1 in one-score games. Last year, they finished 4-5, fueled by six- and four-point wins against the Packers, a one-point win against the Bears, and a three-point win against the Jets. This year, they sit at 4-2. Wasn't it just a year ago that most fans were saying that if this team could just get over .500 in one-score games, they'd make the playoffs? Well folks, we're here. This team is over .500. This team took down the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs in Week 1 on Thursday Night Football, by one point. They beat the Chargers and the Saints by three and five points, respectively. And they beat this same Bears team, in spectacular comeback fashion, by five points just three weeks ago. The losses? Six points to the Seahawks (in OT) and seven points to the Packers on Thanksgiving. This team knows that the game isn't over until the clock hits 0:00, and is willing to fight for every yard, every point, until the last whistle. This is the Brand New Lions, the team that knows how to come away with close games like these. And with tough matchups coming up against the 7-6 Broncos and Vikings and the 10-3 Cowboys, I wouldn't be worried with this Lions team just rolling over quite yet.</p>
        <h2>3. Brad Holmes has a plan.</h2>
        <p>If you had told me that the Lions would be sitting at 9-4 and be sitting in the #3 seed going into the final four games of the season on September 1st, I would have been thrilled. And don't lie, you would have been as well. Many Lions fans, writers, and even national media were predicting this team to have nine or ten wins this season, and winning the division would have been a cherry on top. However, now that we're into the season and have seen some winning, expectations seem to have changed. Nine wins no longer is enough for some, and while I would also love for Detroit to win out and clinch a top playoff spot, I'm also sticking with my preseason expectation of nine or ten wins and a playoff berth. I think other Lions fans should do the same.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the front office, things are quiet as usual. Obviously, Brad Holmes and Dan Campbell continue to try to mitigate problems and win as many games as possible, but I don't believe they're thinking 'run to the Super Bowl' this year. They have done a good job of keeping internal expectations realistic up until this point, and I see no reason to change now. Holmes has built and established a philosophy of building through the draft and a free agent signing here or there. It's hard to believe that he would go all out and try to run the table by pushing their championship window to this year.</p>
        <h2>4. There's still time.</h2>
        <p>240. That's the number of minutes (without possible overtime) that are left in this football season. Four full games. Two against the Vikings, and one each against the Broncos and the Cowboys. There are an infinite number of possible outcomes for the last four Sundays of the regular season. Personally, I'm throwing every ounce of my optimism and my support behind this Lions team, and I'm hoping for the best as we round out the season.</p>
