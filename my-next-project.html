        <h1>My Next Project, and How I’m Going to Do It</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>Lately, I’ve been trying to figure out what my next project should be. Having scrapped the last few for various reasons, I wanted something that would be fun, something I would enjoy, but also something that wouldn’t take up a lot of my time and didn’t need to have a quick deadline, so I could work on it as I pleased. After taking a couple of weeks off to relax and take a lot of the stress off of my plate, I think I’ve found a few ideas that I want to work on for the next few months. Both are mobile/desktop/web apps, which was something I wanted to focus on as I’m trying to improve my software development skills. That said, they also tie into what I love to do most – sports.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The first app that I’m focusing on is one that takes inspiration from a couple of existing platforms. Currently, sports fans around the globe use a variety of different methods to communicate with one another and discuss their teams. But there doesn’t seem to be one single channel where fans from anywhere can follow all of their teams, get news, scores, and more, and interact with other fans of their own team or fans of another team, all in one place. This is the aim of the first app – to bring together fans from all teams and all walks of life on one channel in order to allow them to interact with each other. I don’t have a name for this project yet, but I believe that there are many exciting ideas that could be implemented in order to make this app a fun community for users to participate in. I’ll go deeper on some of these other features in a later piece.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second app I want to work on is one I already have a name for: DebateMe. DebateMe is an app that combines the sports debate aspect of First Take with the face-to-face communication of FaceTime with the random user-matchmaking of Tinder. Here’s the idea: every day, predetermined topics will be generated, based on the news going on in the sports world at the time. Users will then be able to join a “room”, where two users will be face-to-face, via video chat, and will be able to debate each other on the topic. Debates will last roughly 2-5 minutes per topic, and any other users in the room will be able to watch and react via emojis or a chat function. In order to keep the debates high-quality and allow the users to make sure they are watching entertaining content, each user will have a “debate rating”, which will be rated from 0-5 stars, as voted on by each user watching at the end of each debate. These ratings will unlock certain names to display on the user’s profile. For example, if somebody has a five-star rating, they might unlock the “Stephen A. Smith” tier, which will allow the user to display this name on their profile, almost as a status symbol that this person has achieved the highest rating. Another idea is to have a “leaderboard” feature, in which users can see where they rank among the entire user base. This would have to have a cumulative stat to track, like “wins”, where users watching could vote in order to decide who won. This is a possible replacement for the “rating” feature, although I like both ideas.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The development plan for these apps is simple. I’m not the best software developer, so I want to take a few weeks in order to get back into the habit of it. I’ve also decided I’m going to use JavaScript and/or TypeScript to write these apps. I normally use Python in my other projects, so this will take some work in order to learn the new languages, although it shouldn’t be too difficult. Once I feel that I’m ready to begin, the development process is going to utilize a mix of my own ideas with the help of ChatGPT for certain features, which I plan to use extensively in order to ensure I work on building out one part of the app at a time, and make sure I’m writing it correctly. Before I start, I’ll give the bot a roadmap which will be used by the bot and myself in order to point us in the right direction. Features will be added/removed at any time if I believe that they are not needed or come up with a better idea.</p>
        <br>
        <p>These projects could take months or years, depending on how fast I work and how often I work on them. I’m expecting it to take a good amount of work, but also to help me improve my software development skills quite a bit. A *rough* estimate is that I should have at least one done by the end of the year, although things change very quickly, and I’m unsure what my summer or fall will look like in terms of other commitments. I’m excited for these projects and to be able to work on something which I can put out for others to use, and to be able to share my love of sports with the world. I’ll keep updating my website with more updates and insights as I continue to work on these projects.</p>
